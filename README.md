# Surfs_up
  An analysis of temperatures in Hawaii to influence our decision on whether or not to establish a surf shop. 

## Purpose
  To familairze oneself and distunguish differences between SQLite and SQLAlchemy. One should know how to extract data from a SQLite file using a session query and convert the extracted data into a Pandas Dataframe.
  
## Analysis of Project
Seeing summer time (June) and winter (December) temperatures, there isnt much of a difference in the average weather year-long. With December having an average of 71 degrees farenheit, surfing wouldn't be completely off the charts due to cold weather; in fact, several people, especially if theyre surfing aficionados, would still go out and surf. Since winter time is normally the coldest season across the U.S. region, it is safe to assume that spring, fall, and summer should all have a slightly higher average temperature than our records of temperature in Hawaii recorded for December. Higher temperatures across different seasons indicate a more preferable, ideal surfing weather. Overall, opening a surf shop in Hawaii based of temperature records is a good idea; however, there are still several other factors to consider  besides temperature alone.

### Factors to consider
- Precipitation levels
- Humidity
- Dew Points
- Wind speed 
- Wind direction
- Competition
